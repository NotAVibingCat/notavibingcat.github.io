            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I make music as a hobby and sometimes I compose for games.</p>
            <p>Feel free to check out my YouTube channel where I post my music. One of my favourite artists is Owl City and latley I've been taking a bit of inspiration, I also like collecting CDs.</p>
            <p>This site holds a list of all my socials and work, browse around if you'd like.</p>

            <h2>How I make my music</h2>
            <p>I have been using FL Studio since I started making music.</p>
            <p>My favourite generators are FLEX and the Komplete Start Series from Native Instruments.</p>
            <p>I don't have a lot of tehnical knowledge, as I only make music as a hobby in my free time but I'd like to change that in the future.</p>
